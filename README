# bangkok db
## a little web interface for you databases

:info
  im a python dev but wanted to do something in ruby so you will probably find alot of this code ugly

:requirements
  rubygems, sinatra, haml, sequel, mysql & rack-test for tests

:todo
  list databases directly from sequel (sequel mailing list says this isnt currently possible)
  edit data functionality
  edit schema functionality
  new look
  cleanup haml (mainly around if statements)
  add tests that don't depend on my development environment

:thanks/credit
  django guys for the css
